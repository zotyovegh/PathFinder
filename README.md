Based on development time, working hours and final product, this pathfinder visualizer project has been my biggest side-project during my education.

The idea is originated from Clement Mihailescu's Pathfinder game, but has been extended in a great scale with plenty of features. With respect to his original idea, his design choices have been applied to the system, although the logic behind is fundamentally different.

Important features to mention:
* Choices of Dijkstra, A-star, Depth-first and Breadth-first search algorithms implemented
* More than a dozen maze algorithms, to give the right space for the searching methods to grow
* Bidirectional searching
* Allowance of Diagonal search
* Distance visualization
* Manual wall drawing
The project, later has been updated to use CDD and ScSS
